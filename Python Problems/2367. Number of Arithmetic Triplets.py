2367. Number of Arithmetic Triplets
You are given a 0-indexed, strictly increasing integer array nums and a positive integer diff.
A triplet (i, j, k) is an arithmetic triplet if the following conditions are met:

i < j < k,
nums[j] - nums[i] == diff, and
nums[k] - nums[j] == diff.
Return the number of unique arithmetic triplets.
